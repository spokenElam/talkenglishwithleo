        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>We provide a "Daily Mission + Coach Feedback" online English coaching service ("Service"). This Service is designed as a progressive journey:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>**Phase 1: Build Clarity (The Foundation):** Focuses on correcting grammar, basic pronunciation, and sentence structure to ensure clear and accurate communication. This is the starting point for all students.</li>
            <li>**Phase 2: Aim for British Fluency (Optional Path):** Once your tutor assesses that your foundation is solid, you may opt into this advanced path. Focus shifts to British slang, idiomatic phrases, and accent refinement via Accent-Level Audio Feedback. (*Note for Advanced Students: Your tutor will assess you in the first week. If your foundation is already strong, you may begin Phase 2 immediately.*)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Service includes:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>One (1) learning mission sent via WhatsApp / WeChat per calendar day (Monday to Sunday, including public holidays).</li>
            <li>A 10-minute scheduled synchronous (live) text-messaging session with your tutor per week.</li>
        </ul>
